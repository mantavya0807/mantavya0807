# hey, I'm Mantavya üëã

CS + Math @ Penn State, graduating December 2025. I build things that solve real problems, usually involving too much coffee and late night debugging sessions.

Currently breaking (and fixing) LLMs at **Scale AI** while trying to convince my meal plan optimizer not to suggest I eat chicken tenders for the fifth day in a row.

## what I'm actually working on

**reverse engineering Penn State's dining system** because I was tired of losing meal plan money  
‚îú‚îÄ [Mealer](https://github.com/mantavya0807/Mealer) - scraped 5000+ transactions from 150+ students  
‚îú‚îÄ built MFA-aware Puppeteer bots that don't get blocked  
‚îî‚îÄ turns out idempotent Celery tasks are harder than I thought (97% sync rate after many failures)

**replicating economic research papers** for fun (and because someone said I couldn't)  
‚îú‚îÄ [EPU-Index](https://github.com/mantavya0807/EPU-Index) - ingesting 50,000+ news headlines via ProQuest API  
‚îú‚îÄ TF-IDF + spaCy pipeline hit 0.72 correlation with the real EPU index  
‚îî‚îÄ learning that backfilling at 1500/min without rate limits requires... creativity

**teaching a MIPS CPU to not explode** (extended my architecture project way past the deadline)  
‚îú‚îÄ implemented forwarding, hazard detection, stall control  
‚îî‚îÄ added jal and jr support because why not

##3x hackathon winner üèÜ

## things I've actually shipped

**[M8](https://github.com/mantavya0807/M8)** - event platform serving 5000+ users  
hit 1440 req/sec at p95 latency under 180ms, learned more about connection pooling than any tutorial could teach

**[Decluttered.ai](https://github.com/KanikaGupta16/Decluttered.ai)** üèÜ - won mHacks 2024  
multi-agent workflow crawling and classifying products, reduced content creation from 30min to 12min per item

**[homeharmony-platform](https://github.com/mantavya0807/homeharmony-platform)** ‚≠ê - real estate platform with Stripe  
learned that payment flows have more edge cases than a dodecahedron, live at [sub-space.me](https://sub-space.me/)

**[Mealer](https://github.com/mantavya0807/Mealer)** ‚≠ê‚≠ê - 150+ Penn State students trust this daily  
hardest part wasn't the code, it was convincing people to give me their dining credentials

**[FinGuard](https://github.com/mantavya0807/FinGuard)** üèÜ ‚≠ê - won BitCamp, stops phishing attacks  
built because my roommate almost lost $500 to a fake Venmo email

**[BlockHouse](https://github.com/mantavya0807/BlockHouse)** - financial data analysis platform  
TypeScript + charting libraries, processing market data in real-time

**[SecureWater](https://github.com/mantavya0807/SecureWater)** - IoT water quality monitoring  
TypeScript stack tracking contamination alerts

**[eduAI](https://github.com/mantavya0807/eduAI)** - AI scheduling assistant for students  
built for Nittany AI Showcase, parses messy syllabi into actual schedules

**[BERT4Rec](https://github.com/mantavya0807/BERT4Rec)** - product recommendation system  
SVD to compress 128D embeddings to 10D while keeping 92% of the data, hit 64% recommendation accuracy

**[CourseCrafter](https://github.com/mantavya0807/CourseCrafter)** - smart course schedule optimizer  
helps students build schedules that don't result in 8am classes three days in a row

**[fitness-pose-coach](https://github.com/mantavya0807/fitness-pose-coach)** - AI form tracking  
turns out detecting if someone's squat form sucks is harder than I thought

## side quests

**tutoring calculus and linear algebra** at Penn State Learning since Feb 2025  
turns out explaining eigenvectors to freshmen at 8am is harder than implementing them

**leading Penn State Esports web dev** (yes, we have an esports team)  
coordinating 4 developers who all want to use different React patterns

**research with Dr. Wu on assembly parser-printers** (NSF REU Summer 2025)  
Python + OCaml combo that made me appreciate type systems

**[Wenlan-Research](https://github.com/mantavya0807/Wenlan-Research)** - built product rec systems for Prof Yu and Rangaswamy  
that BERT4Rec project above, created product embeddings using fuzzy matching

**[MASBio research](https://github.com/mantavya0807/MasBIO)** with Dr. Jacobson cleaning bioenergy datasets  
learned that "cleaning data" means "discovering 47 different date formats"

## random facts

- wrote a Verilog CPU and then kept adding features nobody asked for
- competed in job simulations for companies I'll probably apply to
- once optimized PostgreSQL queries at 2am and saw an 18% improvement (couldn't sleep after that)
- maintain a chess engine that uses minimax (it's decent but not great)
- unironically enjoy writing documentation

## let's talk

*"most bugs are just features you haven't documented yet"* - me, at 3am, convincing myself the crash is intentional
